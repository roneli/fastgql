## Introduction

GraphQL mutations are used to modify data on the server such as updating, creating or deleting.&#x20;

FastGQL auto generates mutations using the [#generatemutations](../schema/directives.md#generatemutations "mention") directive in your schema.

## Types of mutations

The following types of mutations are possible:

* [insert.md](insert.mdx "mention")
* [update.md](update.mdx "mention")
* [delete.md](delete.mdx "mention")
