FastGQL auto extends the schema using the `@generate` directive to add aggregation queries to the extended types. Aggregation results can be accessed using the `_[fieldName]Aggregate` field in the GraphQL query.&#x20;

FastGQL supports the following aggregation operations: `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`.

## Count Aggregate

```graphql
query {
    _postsAggregate {
        count
    }
}
```

## Aggregate Filter

Similar to [filter ](filtering.mdx)queries we can filter our aggregate queries to returned different results. The following example will count all posts that have a category with the `id == 1` .

```graphql
query {
    _postsAggregate(filter: {categories: {id:{eq: 1}}}) {
        count
    }
}
```

## Group By

Group by is used to group the results based on the given field. The following example will group all posts based on the `NAME` and return the count of posts in each group.
We can GroupBy multiple fields by providing an array of fields, or a single field. The group field will be an object with the grouped fields as keys.

        ```graphql
        query {
            _postsAggregate(groupBy: [NAME]) {
                group
                count
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Multiple">
        ```graphql
        query {
            _postsAggregate(groupBy: [USER_ID, NAME]) {
                group
                count
            }
        }
            ```
