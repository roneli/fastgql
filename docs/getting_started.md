description: How to setup fastGQL

# Getting Started

This tutorial will take you through the process of building a GraphQL server with fastgql that can:

* automatically query, filter, order and pagination users, posts & categories from a postgres database.

You can find the finished code for this tutorial [here](https://github.com/roneli/fastgql/tree/master/example).

If you are familiar with [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com), the setup is nearly identical, with a little work in your Schema you won't need to define any resolvers!

## Setup Project

Create a directory for your project, and initialise it as a Go Module:

```bash
$ mkdir fastgql-example
$ cd fastgql-example 
$ go mod init github.com/[username]/fastgql-example
$ go get github.com/roneli/fastgql
```

#### Add github.com/roneli/fastgql to your project’s tools.go

```bash
printf '// +build tools\npackage tools\nimport _ "github.com/roneli/fastgql"' | gofmt > tools.go
go mod tidy
```

## Building the server

### Create the project skeleton

```bash
$ go run github.com/roneli/fastgql init
$ go mod tidy
```

This will create our suggested package layout. You can modify these paths in gqlgen.yml if you need to.

```
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── gqlgen.yml               - The gqlgen config file, knobs for controlling the generated code.
├── graph
│   ├── generated            - A package that only contains the generated runtime
│   │   └── generated.go
│   ├── model                - A package for all your graph models, generated or otherwise
│   │   └── models_gen.go
│   ├── resolver.go          - The root graph resolver type. This file wont get regenerated
|   ├── fastgql.graphql      - fastgql schema fragemnt, adding all directives, inputs etc' required for schema augment
│   ├── schema.graphql       - Some schema. You can split the schema into as many graphql files as you like
│   └── schema.fastgql.go    - the resolver implementation for schema.graphql
└── server.go                - The entry point to your app. Customize it however you see fit
```

### Define your schema

gqlgen is a schema-first library — before writing code, you describe your API using the GraphQL [Schema Definition Language](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/). By default this goes into a file called `schema.graphql` but you can break it up into as many different files as you want.

The schema that was generated for us was:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```graphql
type User @generateFilterInput(name: "UserFilterInput") @tableName(name: "user"){
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post] @relation(relationType: ONE_TO_MANY, baseTable: "user", refTable: "posts", fields: ["id"], references: ["user_id"])
}

type Post @generateFilterInput(name: "PostFilterInput") {
  id: Int!
  name: String
  categories: [Category] @relation(relationType: MANY_TO_MANY, baseTable: "posts", refTable: "categories", fields: ["id"], references: ["id"]
    manyToManyTable: "posts_to_categories", manyToManyFields: ["post_id"], manyToManyReferences: ["category_id"])
  user: User @relation(relationType: ONE_TO_ONE, baseTable: "posts", refTable: "user", fields: ["user_id"], references: ["id"])
}


type Category @generateFilterInput(name: "CategoryFilterInput"){
  id: Int!
  name: String
}

type Query @generate {
  posts: [Post]
  users: [User]
  categories: [Category] @skipGenerate
}
```
{% endcode %}

### Implement the resolvers

`fastgql generate` compares the schema file (`schema.graphql`) with the models `graph/model/*` and wherever it can it will bind directly to the model. It generates resolvers just like gqlgen, but also implements some resolvers to directly work with the database.

If we take a look in `graph/schema.fastgql.go` you will see all the resolvers that fastgql autogenerated for example:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```go
func (r *queryResolver) Posts(ctx context.Context, limit *int, offset *int, orderBy *model.PostOrdering, filter *model.PostFilterInput) ([]*model.Post, error) {
 	var data []*model.Post
	if err := r.Executor.Scan(ctx, "postgres", &data); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return data, nil
}
```
{% endcode %}

We just need to start a postgres server and insert a schema, you can try the example's [compose file](https://github.com/roneli/fastgql/tree/master/example/docker-compose.yml) and execute the [schema.sql](https://github.com/roneli/fastgql/blob/master/example/graph/schema.graphql):

Finally, we just need to define our postgres connection str that defined in server.go. We can override with `PG_CONN_STR` env variable.

If we used the example's docker compose we can use this DSN: `PG_CONN_STR=postgresql://localhost/postgres?user=postgres&password=password`

We now have a working server, to start it:

```bash
go run server.go
```

then open http://localhost:8080 in a browser. here are some queries to try:

```graphql
query {
  posts(limit: 2) {
    name
    categories {
      name
    }
  }
}
query filterPostsByUser {
  posts(limit: 10, filter: {user:{name: {eq: "fastgql"}}}, orderBy: {name: ASC}) {
    name
    categories {
      name
    }
    user {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Finishing touches

At the top of our `server.go`, between `package` and `import`, add the following line:

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/roneli/fastgql generate -c gqlgen.yml
```

This magic comment tells `go generate` what command to run when we want to regenerate our code. To run go generate recursively over your entire project, use this command:

```go
go generate ./...
```
