### What is fastGQL?

[_fastGQL_](https://github.com/roneli/fastgql) is a Go library that extends [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) to create a blazing-fast GraphQL server that gives you instant, realtime GraphQL APIs over Postgres.

* **fastgql is based on a Schema first approach** â€” You get to Define your API using the GraphQL [Schema Definition Language](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/).
* **fastgql prioritizes extendability** â€” You can modify resolvers, add your own custom operators and even create your own database query builder.
* **fastgql enables codegen** â€” We generate even more of the boring CRUD bits, so you can focus on building your app even faster!

### Getting Started

* To install fastgql run the command `go get github.com/roneli/fastgql` in your project directory.\

* You could initialize a new project using the recommended folder structure by running this command `go run github.com/roneli/fastgql init`.

You could find a more comprehensive guide on [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) to help you get started [here](https://gqlgen.com/getting-started/). We also have a couple of [examples](https://github.com/roneli/fastgql/tree/master/example) that show how fastgql generates the full API seamlessly.

### Reporting Issues

If you think you've found a bug, or something isn't behaving the way you think it should, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/roneli/fastgql/issues) on GitHub.

### Contributing

Feel free to open Pull-Request for small fixes and changes. For bigger changes and new builders please open an [issue](https://github.com/roneli/fastgql/issues) first to prevent double work and discuss relevant stuff.

### Roadmap ðŸš§

* More tests
* configurable database connections
* Support multiple database (mongodb, cockroachDB, neo4j)
