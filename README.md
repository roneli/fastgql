## What is fastGQL?

[*fastGQL*](https://github.com/roneli/fastgql) is a Go library that
extends [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) to create a blazing-fast GraphQL server that gives you instant,
realtime GraphQL APIs over Postgres.

- **fastgql is based on a Schema first approach** â€” You get to Define your API using the
  GraphQL [Schema Definition Language](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/).
- **fastgql prioritizes extendability** â€” You can modify resolvers, add your own custom operators and even create your
  own database query builder.
- **fastgql enables codegen** â€” We generate even more of the boring CRUD bits, so you can focus on building your app
  even faster!

## Getting Started

- To install fastgql run the command `go get github.com/roneli/fastgql` in your project directory.<br/>
- You could initialize a new project using the recommended folder structure by running this
  command `go run github.com/roneli/fastgql init`.

You could find a more comprehensive guide on [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) to help you get
started [here](https://gqlgen.com/getting-started/).
We also have a couple of  [examples](https://github.com/roneli/fastgql/tree/master/example) that show how fastgql
generates the full API seamlessly.

## Reporting Issues
